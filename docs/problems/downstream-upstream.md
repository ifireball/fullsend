# Downstream/Upstream

How do downstream contributors express business priorities into an open source project, and how does the project reconcile competing sources of strategic intent?

## Why this matters now

Many open source projects have a single dominant downstream contributor — a company that employs most contributors, funds the infrastructure, and drives the roadmap. That company's priorities become project priorities by default because nobody else is at the table.

This works — until it doesn't. A project's governance structure (elected steering committees, ADR processes, open contribution) may be designed to support a multi-lateral community. But there is often no formal mechanism for how downstream contributor business priorities become project priorities. That gap is invisible with one downstream contributor. With two or more, it becomes the central political question of the project.

Two things typically exist that partially address direction-setting:

1. **A governance body** (steering committee, technical council, etc.) has formal authority over architectural decisions. This governs the *shape* of the system — how things are built, what invariants hold.
2. **Feature direction** — *what* gets built and in what order — flows informally from the dominant contributor's internal planning. No project-level body formally owns this.

The gap between these two is where this problem lives.

## The contribution-weighted model and why it's breaking

Open source projects have traditionally resolved priority conflicts through contribution-weighted influence: what gets built is what someone shows up to build. If a downstream contributor wants a feature, it assigns engineers to implement it. If nobody cares enough to write the code, the feature doesn't happen.

This worked as a natural filter. Code was expensive to produce. Only well-motivated priorities attracted sufficient investment. The cost of implementation served as a proxy for organizational commitment.

LLM-generated code breaks this model. When any contributor can produce a polished implementation for the cost of an afternoon's token budget, the filter disappears. A well-implemented PR is no longer evidence that the contributing organization made a strategic commitment — it may just mean someone had an idea and an API key.

Saying "no" to a contribution has always been socially expensive — when someone invested weeks of effort, rejecting their PR felt like denying their worth. Cheap code doesn't eliminate this dynamic; it compounds it with volume. A project that must say "no" ten times a week to well-implemented but strategically misaligned contributions burns through social capital fast.

This creates a new problem: the project must now evaluate contributions against strategic intent, not just technical quality. "Done" is no longer evidence that something "should be done." Without an explicit priority mechanism, the project risks accepting well-crafted contributions that warp its shape in ways no stakeholder actually intended.

## Models for priority intake

### Model A: Single central list

All contributors play in one priority list with no special treatment for downstream contributor organizations. Anyone proposes features through the same process — for example, an intent repo's `proposed/` directory as described in [intent-representation.md](intent-representation.md). The governance body authorizes what moves forward.

Downstream contributor PMs and architects have no formal standing in the project. They are contributors like anyone else. Their influence comes from the quality of their proposals, not their employer.

**Strengths:**
- Simple and egalitarian
- Prevents capture by any single downstream contributor
- Consistent with open source norms

**Weaknesses:**
- Ignores the reality that downstream contributors fund the work. A downstream contributor investing heavily in people and infrastructure has legitimate interest in direction. Pretending otherwise may drive downstream contributors to fork or disengage.
- No mechanism for downstream contributors to plan internally against the project roadmap, because they don't control it.

### Model B: Federated priority lists with reconciliation

Each contributing organization maintains its own priority list. A reconciliation process — run by the governance body, a priority council, or a rotating chair — merges these into a project roadmap. Conflicts surface explicitly rather than through informal politics.

**Strengths:**
- Acknowledges that downstream contributors have distinct business needs
- Makes conflicts visible rather than hidden
- Allows downstream contributors to plan internally against their own list while still coordinating

**Weaknesses:**
- Overhead of the reconciliation process
- Risk of gridlock when priorities conflict directly
- Who breaks ties? The largest contributor has the most leverage regardless of formal structure.

### Model C: Downstream contributor priorities as input, project priorities as output

Downstream contributors submit priority requests, but the project maintains its own independent priority list owned by the governance body. Downstream contributor input is one signal among several — community demand, technical debt, security needs, architectural health. An explicit insulating layer separates downstream contributor priorities from project priorities.

The project can say "no" to a downstream contributor priority that would fragment the codebase or conflict with architectural invariants. Downstream contributors accept that their priorities are requests, not directives.

**Strengths:**
- Protects project coherence — the governance body can reject priorities that would fragment the project
- Balances business needs against project health
- Makes the insulating layer explicit rather than pretending it doesn't exist

**Weaknesses:**
- Downstream contributors may feel they lack influence proportional to their investment
- The insulating layer could become a bottleneck or a political arena
- Requires the governance body (or a delegated group) to make judgment calls that will sometimes displease major funders

### Model D: Contribution-weighted influence (current state)

No formal priority mechanism. What gets built is what someone builds. This is the default state of most open source projects — and the model that LLM-generated code is disrupting (see previous section).

**Strengths:**
- Zero overhead
- Self-regulating when code is expensive to produce

**Weaknesses:**
- Breaks down when code is cheap — volume of contributions no longer signals organizational commitment
- No protection against project fragmentation through well-implemented but unwanted contributions
- Provides no framework for resolving conflicts between downstream contributors with different visions

## Failure modes

No model eliminates all failure modes. The choice is which failures you structurally prevent and which you tolerate.

### Fragmentation (most dangerous)

Multiple downstream contributors pull the project in incompatible directions. Under Model A, this manifests as competing feature proposals that can't coexist architecturally. Under Model B, reconciliation fails to find common ground and both features get built, creating maintenance burden and confused users. Under Model C, the insulating layer picks winners and losers, and losers may fork.

A governance body's existing architectural authority provides some defense — architectural invariants constrain the design space — but architectural decisions govern structure, not feature direction. Two features can each be architecturally sound while still being strategically incompatible.

### Capture

The largest contributor dominates regardless of formal structure. Under Model A, they outnumber others in proposals and discussion. Under Model B, their priority list is longest and their reconciliation leverage is greatest. Under Model C, the governance body members are mostly employed by the dominant downstream contributor, and the "insulating layer" insulates in name only.

Capture is the hardest failure mode to prevent structurally because it reflects real power dynamics. Formal rules help, but only if the community is willing to enforce them against its largest funder.

### Gridlock

Requiring multi-lateral consensus stalls decision-making. Most acute under Model B, where reconciliation can deadlock. Model C mitigates this by giving the governance body final authority, but at the cost of downstream contributor buy-in — a downstream contributor that gets overruled repeatedly may stop investing.

### Freeloading

Downstream contributors consume the project without contributing proportionally. Less existential than the other failure modes, but it corrodes contributor morale. Models B and C make contribution levels visible; Models A and D obscure them.

## The agent dimension

### Agents as accelerant

The priority intake problem exists independent of agents. But agents make it more urgent.

When agents can implement a proposed feature in hours rather than weeks, the volume of "proposed and implemented" contributions increases. The project needs a priority mechanism that operates at agent speed without becoming a rubber stamp. This connects to [intent-representation.md](intent-representation.md)'s tiered model — Tier 2+ features need explicit authorization before agents can merge them. But *who proposes and who authorizes* is the downstream contributor priority question this document addresses.

The intent system's `proposed/` to `approved/` workflow assumes someone is filtering proposals. The priority intake model determines who that someone is and what criteria they use.

## Relationship to other problem areas

- **[Intent representation](intent-representation.md)** — This document addresses *where* strategic intent originates. Intent representation addresses *how* it gets encoded and enforced. The priority intake model feeds the intent system's `proposed/` directory. Note: intent-representation.md currently references "architects and PM" as approvers — these are downstream contributor roles with no formal standing in the project. The priority intake model must clarify how downstream contributor roles relate to project authority.
- **[Governance](governance.md)** — The governance body's role in priority reconciliation is a governance question. This document may motivate expanding the governance discussion beyond agent policy to include feature direction authority.
- **[Agent architecture](agent-architecture.md)** — The backlog/priority agent's design depends on the priority intake model. Its inputs, its ranking criteria, and its authority to assign work all derive from decisions made here.
- **[Autonomy spectrum](autonomy-spectrum.md)** — If different downstream contributors have different risk tolerances for agent autonomy in repos they care about, the priority model needs to account for that tension.

## Open questions

- Should the governance body's mandate expand to cover feature direction, or does that need a separate body?
- How do you prevent the reconciliation process (in Models B and C) from becoming a political arena that drives downstream contributors away?
- If token budget is allocated by contribution, what counts as "contribution"? Code? Infrastructure? Funding? Community management?
- How does this interact with existing architectural decision processes — are they a subset of priority decisions, or a parallel track?
- What's the minimum viable priority process for a project with one downstream contributor today that doesn't preclude multi-lateral participation later?
- How do you detect and prevent capture when the dominant downstream contributor also employs most governance body members?
