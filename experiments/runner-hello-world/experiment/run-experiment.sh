# run-experiment.sh — Build fullsend, sync experiment files to the .fullsend repo,
# upload the binary to a GitHub release, and trigger the workflow.
#
# Usage: ./experiments/runner-hello-world/experiment/run-experiment.sh
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - gh CLI authenticated
#   - Go toolchain installed
#   - podman (for building and pushing container images)
#   - /tmp/dot-fullsend is a clone of test-fullsend/.fullsend
